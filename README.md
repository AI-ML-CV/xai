# XAI - An explainability-first AI library

XAI is a Machine Learning library that is designed with AI explainability in its core. XAI contains various tools that enable for analysis and evaluation of data and models. The XAI library is maintained by [The Institute for Ethical AI & ML](http://ethical.institute/), and it was developed based on the [8 principles for Responsible Machine Learning](http://ethical.institute/principles.html).

## What do we mean by eXplainable AI?

The XAI library is designed to empower machine learning engineers and relevant domain experts to analyse the end-to-end solution and identify discrepancies that may result in sub-optimal performance relative to the objectives required. More concretely, the XAI library is designed using the 3-steps of explainable machine learning, which involve 1) data analysis, 2) model evaluation, and 3) production monitoring. 

The provide a visual overview of these three steps, we can have a look at this in the diagram below:
